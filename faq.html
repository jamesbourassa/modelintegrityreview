    <h2>What MIR is (in one paragraph)</h2>
    <div class="a">
      Model Integrity Review (MIR) provides <strong>independent, management-led, document-based review</strong> of analytical models and
      their supporting documentation, focused on structural clarity, internal consistency, assumption traceability, and documentation
      sufficiency for <strong>management oversight</strong>, audit, or decision use.
      MIR complements existing validation or governance programs by focusing on <strong>clarity and defensibility of the model as documented</strong>,
      not statistical testing or regulatory compliance.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="deliverable">
    <div class="q">What do we get at the end?</div>
    <div class="a">
      A <strong>short written review memorandum</strong> describing review scope, observed strengths, and documentation or structural risks.
      The memorandum is <strong>advisory</strong> and is <strong>not</strong> an endorsement, certification, or validation.
      Depth is driven by model complexity and documentation quality—not a fixed reporting template.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="validation">
    <div class="q">Is this validation, audit, certification, or approval?</div>
    <div class="a">
      No. MIR does not validate correctness or performance, certify compliance, or approve models or outcomes.
      MIR focuses on whether the model is <strong>coherent and defensible as documented</strong>—so leadership can understand what they are relying on.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="materials">
    <div class="q">Do you need our code or data?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Usually no. MIR is document-based and relies on materials you already have (reports, technical notes, appendices, spreadsheets, or excerpts).
      MIR does not run models, collect new data, or infer behavior beyond what is documented.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="assumptions">
    <div class="q">Do you judge whether our assumptions are “right”?</div>
    <div class="a">
      MIR does not assess domain correctness. We assess whether assumptions are <strong>clearly stated</strong>, <strong>internally consistent</strong>,
      and <strong>traceable</strong> to outputs and decisions, and whether limitations are documented in a way management can understand.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="issues">
    <div class="q">What kinds of issues typically emerge?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Common observations include undocumented assumptions, unclear input–output traceability, inconsistent definitions across artifacts,
      hidden dependencies, ambiguous normalization or scaling, and gaps between narrative descriptions and the model’s actual structure.
      These are framed as <strong>documentation or governance risks</strong>, not technical errors.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="who">
    <div class="q">Who typically requests a Model Integrity Review?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Requests most often come from senior managers, consultants, research leads, or governance functions responsible for explaining or standing behind
      a model they did not personally author.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="confidentiality">
    <div class="q">Are engagements confidential?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Yes. Client materials are treated as confidential. MIR does not disclose client identities or reuse client materials across engagements.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="ai">
    <div class="q">Is this AI? Do you use AI tools?</div>
    <div class="a">
      MIR is a <strong>human-led review</strong>. Any internal drafting or analytical tools may be used only as aids.
      All judgment, interpretation, and conclusions are made by the reviewer. There is no automated assessment or AI decision-making.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="team">
    <div class="q">Who performs the review?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Model Integrity Review is deliberately led and delivered by a single Lead Reviewer.
      All reviews are conducted, written, and finalized by the same reviewer to preserve consistency, accountability, and independence.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="pricing">
    <div class="q">How is pricing structured?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Reviews are scoped upfront and priced as a fixed fee. The fee is confirmed before work begins.
      MIR is designed to be a contained decision-support control, not an ongoing engagement.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box" id="not-fit">
    <div class="q">When is MIR not appropriate?</div>
    <div class="a">
      MIR is not appropriate when validation, regulatory sign-off, litigation support, testimony preparation, media strategy,
      or technical redesign is required. In those cases, specialized domain or legal services are more appropriate.
    </div>
    <div class="hr"></div>
    <div class="small muted">
      If you are seeking approval, certification, or technical optimization, MIR is unlikely to be the right fit.
