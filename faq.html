  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">What exactly does Model Integrity Review evaluate?</div>
    <div class="a">
      MIR evaluates the structural clarity, internal consistency, traceability, and documentation quality of analytical models
      and supporting materials. The focus is on whether a model is understandable and defensible as a decision artifact.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">Do you validate or certify model correctness?</div>
    <div class="a">
      No. MIR does not validate technical correctness, certify compliance, or endorse conclusions. The review is structural
      and documentation-focused only.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">Is this a technical or domain-specific review?</div>
    <div class="a">
      No. MIR does not redesign models, debug code, or optimize performance. The review examines how the model is documented,
      structured, and explained — not whether it is “right.”
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">What types of models are appropriate?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Analytical, financial, engineering, simulation-based, policy, and research models may all be appropriate, provided
      the review remains at the documentation and structural level.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">How is the review conducted?</div>
    <div class="a">
      All reviews are document-based and conducted remotely. MIR reviews only the materials provided and does not execute
      or run models.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">What is the deliverable?</div>
    <div class="a">
      A concise written memorandum outlining scope, materials reviewed, observed strengths, documentation and traceability
      risks, and non-prescriptive recommendations, with clear limitations and disclaimers.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">How do we get started?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Send a brief email describing the model’s purpose, intended audience, and available materials. MIR will confirm fit
      and scope by return email.
    </div>
