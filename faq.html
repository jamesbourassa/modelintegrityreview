    <h2>What We Mean by <em>Model Integrity Review</em></h2>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <div class="a small">
      A <em>model</em> is any structured representation used to support understanding or decisions — including
      spreadsheets, forecasts, policy models, simulations, or analytical frameworks.
      If it influences decisions, explanations, or accountability, it is a model.
    </div>

    <h3>Integrity</h3>
    <div class="a small">
      <em>Integrity</em> refers to how well a model holds together <strong>as documented</strong>.
      It means assumptions are visible, inputs and outputs are internally consistent, terminology is clear,
      and the model can be explained without relying on undocumented knowledge.
      Integrity is not about whether a model is “right” — it is about whether it is
      <strong>coherent, traceable, and explainable</strong>.
    </div>

    <h3>Review</h3>
    <div class="a small">
      A <em>review</em> is an independent, document-based examination of existing materials.
      We do not build, modify, run, or validate models.
      Instead, we assess documentation clarity, internal consistency, and explainability,
      and provide an advisory memorandum describing observations and risks.
    </div>

    <h3>In Plain Terms</h3>
    <div class="a small">
      Model Integrity Review helps organizations ensure the models they rely on are
      <strong>clear, consistent, and defensible</strong> — without validating or redesigning
      the models themselves.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">What problem is Model Integrity Review designed to address?</div>
    <div class="a">
      MIR addresses the gap between technically sophisticated models and the clarity required for decision-making,
      review, audit, or external scrutiny. Many models are sound but insufficiently documented, difficult to explain,
      or fragile under questioning. MIR focuses on that structural and documentation layer.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">How is this different from validation, peer review, or quality assurance?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Validation and peer review assess correctness within a technical domain. Quality assurance often checks process
      compliance. MIR does neither. It examines whether the model, as documented, is internally coherent, transparent
      in its assumptions, and defensible as a decision artifact — independent of whether it is “right.”
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">Does a Model Integrity Review imply endorsement or approval?</div>
    <div class="a">
      No. MIR does not endorse conclusions, certify outcomes, or approve decisions. The review is advisory and descriptive.
      Its purpose is to surface documentation and structural risks so decision-makers understand where clarity exists
      and where it does not.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">What materials does the review rely on?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Reviews are based solely on materials provided by the client, such as reports, technical memoranda, appendices,
      spreadsheets, or excerpts. MIR does not run models, collect new data, or infer behavior beyond what is documented.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">What kinds of issues typically emerge in a review?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Common observations include undocumented assumptions, unclear input–output traceability, inconsistent terminology,
      ambiguous normalization or scaling choices, and gaps between narrative descriptions and actual structure.
      These are framed as documentation or governance risks, not technical errors.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">Who typically requests a Model Integrity Review?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Requests most often come from senior managers, consultants, research leads, or governance functions responsible
      for explaining or standing behind a model they did not personally author.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">How should the review be used after delivery?</div>
    <div class="a">
      The review memorandum is intended to support internal understanding, documentation improvement, and informed
      discussion. It may be shared internally or with reviewers at the client’s discretion, with the understanding
      that it is not a certification or validation document.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">Are engagements confidential?</div>
    <div class="a">
      Yes. All client materials are treated as confidential. MIR does not disclose client information or reuse materials
      across engagements. Internal analytical aids used during review are not client-facing.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="q">When is a Model Integrity Review not appropriate?</div>
    <div class="a">
      MIR is not appropriate when validation, regulatory sign-off, litigation support, or technical redesign is required.
      In such cases, specialized domain or legal services are more appropriate.
