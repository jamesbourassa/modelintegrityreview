      Model Integrity Review engagements are independent, document-based, and advisory.
      They do not involve model execution, validation, certification, or redesign.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Initial Inquiry & Scope Screening</strong><br/>
        A brief exchange confirms the nature of the model, the intended use of the review,
        and whether the engagement fits MIR’s scope and boundaries.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Engagement Confirmation</strong><br/>
        Scope, timeline, deliverables, and fee are confirmed in writing before work begins.
        Reviews proceed only after mutual agreement on boundaries and expectations.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Materials Intake</strong><br/>
        Client-provided documents are received and logged.
        These materials form the sole basis of the review; no external inference or model execution is performed.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Structural Model Mapping</strong><br/>
        The documented structure of the model is mapped at a conceptual level,
        including inputs, assumptions, transformations, and outputs as described in the materials.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Consistency, Traceability & Clarity Review</strong><br/>
        Documentation is examined for internal consistency, assumption visibility,
        terminology alignment, and traceability between narrative descriptions and structure.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Review Memorandum Preparation</strong><br/>
        A concise written memorandum (typically 2–4 pages) summarizes observations,
        highlights documentation or governance risks, and notes areas where clarity may be improved.
        Findings are descriptive and non-prescriptive.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Delivery</strong><br/>
        The memorandum is delivered electronically to the client.
        Use and distribution are at the client’s discretion, subject to engagement terms.
      </li>
    </ol>

      Model Integrity Review is designed to support understanding, explanation, and defensibility of models
      as documented — not to determine correctness or approve decisions.
